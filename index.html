  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <p>
  Hi! I’m Mia, </br>
Currently creating product prototypes based on users’ research to show SAP customers the unlocked innovative potential they get after implementing SAP technologies. </br>

I’m passionate about end users and accessibility.</br>
Why end users? </br>
	We’re all looking at how we can make our lives easier, better, more enjoyable. Understanding the end user mean understanding what moves people, what makes them tick. It’s not about making a product people want to use. It’s about making a product people need to use.</br>

Why accessibility?</br>
	I’m hard of hearing and some products on the market treat that as an obstacle. Catering for all abilities is not something “extra” to have; it’s a necessity. When we design for all abilities, we open ourselves to more possibilities and address more needs that we intended; that creates more robust products.</br>

Let’s meet – I’d love to answer any question you might have and connect with fellow like-minded people to discuss our love for design.</br>
